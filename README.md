# Virtual Pet

## Overview

**Virtual Pet** is a mobile application that allows users to adopt and care for a virtual pet. The app is built with SwiftUI for iOS and utilizes a Java-based backend to store and manage pet data, ensuring a dynamic experience for the user. Players can interact with their pet by feeding, playing, and maintaining its health and happiness.

This project demonstrates the integration of a modern SwiftUI frontend with a backend developed in Java, available at this [link](https://github.com/marinaaguiar/ITAcademy-VirtualPet-Backend).

## Features

- **Adopt a virtual pet**: Choose your pet and give it a name.
- **Pet care system**: Interact with your pet by feeding, playing, and monitoring its overall well-being.
- **Real-time updates**: The backend tracks and updates the petâ€™s health and happiness levels.
- **Cross-platform communication**: The SwiftUI frontend communicates with a Java backend for data storage and retrieval.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI (for building modern and responsive user interfaces)

### Backend
- **Language**: Java
- **API**: RESTful API built in Java
- **Repository**: [ITAcademy-VirtualPet-Backend](https://github.com/marinaaguiar/ITAcademy-VirtualPet-Backend)

## Architecture

This project follows a client-server architecture where:
- The **iOS app** serves as the frontend, built using **SwiftUI**.
- The **backend** handles the data and logic of the virtual pet, developed in **Java** and hosted separately.

## Installation

### Frontend (iOS)

Xcode version 16.0

Swift version 5.7

Minimum deployment iOS 16.0

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marinaaguiar/ITAcademy-VirtualPet.git

2. **Open in Xcode:**:
   Open the project in Xcode by navigating to the .xcodeproj file.

3. **Build and Run:**
   Select your target device or simulator and press Run in Xcode.

### Backend (Java)

1. **Clone the backend repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marinaaguiar/ITAcademy-VirtualPet-Backend.git
   
4. **Follow the instructions** in the backend repository for setting up and running the server.


### How to Use

Launch the iOS app and adopt your virtual pet by choosing from the available options.
Interact with your pet: Use the buttons to feed, play, and monitor the health and happiness levels.
Pet data is managed via the backend, so all interactions update the pet's condition in real time.
Ensure that the backend server is running to allow for smooth communication between the app and the database.
